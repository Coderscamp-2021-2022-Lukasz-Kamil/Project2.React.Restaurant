### General Information

---

We're proud to let you know that together we've finished working on our app for an Italian restaurant owner! As you know nowadays, without a website, it is very difficult to advertise a restaurant and to expand its reach and gain new customers. That is why we are facing these problems with an application that is designed to show an offer of an Italian restaurant and provide all the information needed to reach and visit it.
<br></br>
In addition, it allows the restaurant owner to freely edit the displayed content of the restaurant menu and add new users who can help him in the process of maintaining the site!
